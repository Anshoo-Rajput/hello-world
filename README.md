# Covid-info
Covid-info/help is a website that serves two main purposes. Firstly it's an information site on Covid-19. It displays real time statistics of world(country-wise) and India(state-wise and district-wise) regarding Covid-19 condition. Users can also get information about Covid-19 testing centers, helpline-nos, NGO's, Hospitals, etc. available in various cities of India. The website also has a unique news feature that renders 10 latest news related to Covid-19 of the place entered by the user. 
Secondly, through Covid-help website small business shops can take their stores online. ShopOwners will be able to accept online orders, easily maintain record of orders and generate computerised bill. Maps feature is also added for easy navigation to shops.



# Motivation
 The very world we know and love is changing by the second due to the spread of COVID-19. People are stuck in their houses and are badly impacted by this crisis. People are very curious about questions like -
 * How many cases has my City registered
 * What is the totals number of active cases in India or Worldwide
 * What are the latest news regarding Covid-19 of my city
 * Are there any Covid testing labs, hospitals, free food shelters, NGOs, etc. nearby me
 * Which phone number to dial in case of emergency?
 All these questions were the basis of our Covid-info project and we tried to create a one-stop solution for all questions.
 
Another problem faced by people now is crowding of people in front of grocery stores while collecting orders. This leads to total disruption of the concept of social distancing. So our team thought of designing a website where these small grocery stores can take their stores online. People can place online orders from home and come to the shop to directly collect their order. Thereby reducing the need to wait in long queues and also enforce social distancing. Therefore we have launched Covid-help website.
